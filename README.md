# ELECTRICITY-CONSUMPTION-PRICES-DASHBOARD
Project Overview:
This project analyzes electricity consumption and pricing data across various countries, focusing on trends from 2013 to 2019. The insights gathered highlight disparities in electricity prices, consumption patterns, and the growth of demand in different regions.

Key Insights
1. Highest vs. Lowest Electricity Prices
   
Highest Electricity Prices:
Venezuela 
Solomon Islands
Liberia.

Lowest Electricity Prices:
Afghanistan 
Angola 
Benin 

3. Relationship Between Price and Consumption:
A negative correlation exists between electricity prices and per capita consumption. Countries with higher prices, such as Venezuela and Liberia, tend to have lower consumption rates, while countries with the lowest prices like Afghanistan and Angola exhibit higher consumption levels despite their economic challenges.

4. Biggest Growth in Demand Over the Last 10 Years
Countries experiencing significant increases in electricity demand include:

India: Increased from 654.38 kWh per capita in 2013 to 863.01 kWh in 2019.
Bangladesh: Slight increase from 7.86 kWh per capita in 2013 to 7.88 kWh in 2019.
Ethiopia: Growth from 0 kWh per capita in 2013 to 0.086 kWh in 2019.
Zambia: Remarkable increase from 0 kWh per capita in 2013 to 90.20 kWh in 2019, indicating significant growth in demand.

4. Affordability of Electricity Over Time:
Trends indicate that electricity prices have remained stable or increased over time, potentially impacting affordability, especially in developing countries. For instance:

Venezuela: Prices reached $10.38
In 2019, marking the highest in the dataset.
Afghanistan: Although prices remained unchanged, low consumption persists due to limited access.
Zambia: Experienced a rise in demand in conjunction with efforts to improve electricity access.

Conclusion:

The analysis reveals a complex relationship between electricity pricing and consumption, highlighting the challenges of affordability in many regions. The insights from this project aim to inform policymakers and stakeholders about the dynamics of electricity markets and the importance of ensuring affordable access to electricity for all.
